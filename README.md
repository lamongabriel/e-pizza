# e-pizza
Fully responsive and customizable front-end website for selling pizzas, to be used in a small business or small town.
Made with only HTML5, CSS3 and pure JavaScript

This project's purpose was to develop my front-end skill's, it has no real-world application for me, although it can be used in real cases if implemented with a back-end solution and a checkout form.
Feel free to use it.
